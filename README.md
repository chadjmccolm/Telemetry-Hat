# Objective

This board is designed to replace [this board](http://skpang.co.uk/catalog/pican-canbus-board-retired-replacement-available-p-1196.html) on our telemetry setup. It will have the same function but be a Pi Hat which will allow us to better secure it to the Pi. It will also have a compliant connector with the Unicorn standard.
